# Multithreading in C++

This repository contains a collection of C++ programs exploring multithreading concepts, concurrent programming, and parallel algorithms.

## Contents

The repository includes:
- **Multithreading Basics**: Simple examples demonstrating how to create and manage threads in C++.
- **Concurrency**: Examples of concurrent data structures and synchronization primitives such as mutexes and condition variables.
- **Parallel Algorithms**: Implementation and usage examples of parallel algorithms provided by the C++ standard library.

## Usage

Each .cpp file in the repository is a standalone example demonstrating a specific multithreading concept or technique. You can compile and run these programs individually to see how multithreading works in different scenarios.

## Prerequisites

To compile and run these examples, you need:
- A C++ compiler that supports C++11 or higher (e.g., GCC, Clang, Visual Studio).
- Basic knowledge of C++ programming and familiarity with multithreading concepts.

## Running Examples

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/MatiasCarabella/multithreading-cpp.git
    cd multithreading-cpp
    ```
2. Compile and run individual files & examples
